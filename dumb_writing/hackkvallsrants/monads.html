<h1>Why Monads?</h1>
<p>So, <i>monads</i> (UK: <i>Monn-add</i>, US: <i>Moe-nadd</i>) are a
thing used kinda everywhere in Functional Programming and beyond, even
if people don't know that what they're working with is a monad once
you leave the FP space.</p>

<h2>What is a monad?</h2>
<p>
A monad is a container that can have a neutral (empty) state and a
set of operations on the things that maybe exist within it. These
operations also need to obey a set of laws.
</p>

<h2>What?</h2>
<p>Let's start with a list and function called <code>map</code>.</p>

<pre>
myList = [1,2,3,4] :: [Int]
someFunction = λx → x + 1 :: Int → Int

$ map someFunction myList
> [2,3,4,5]
</pre>

<p>Hopefully you've seen <code>map</code> before. Now consider a
special list that can at most take one element:</p>

<pre>
data MaxOneList α
  = One α
  | Empty
</pre>

<p>Surely map should work on this list too.</p>
<pre>
map :: (α → β) → MaxOneList α → MaxOneList β
map _ Empty   = Empty
map f (One x) = One (f x)
</pre>

<p>
Now a list of max one element might seem like a dumb idea, but that's
essentially what a <code>Maybe</code> or an <code>Option</code> is.
</p>

<pre>
data MaxOneList α │ data Maybe α │ data Option
  = One α         │   = Just α   │   = Some α
  | Empty         │   | Nothing  │   | None
</pre>

<p>
So clearly map is a function that should operate over a greater set of
types than just the simple list. In the haskell world we call this set
of types Functors and the interface is just that simple.
</p>

<pre>
class Functor container where
  fmap :: (α → β) → container α → container β
</pre>

<p>Now we can write code that is generic over any container that has α
reasonable implementation of <code>map</code>.</p>

<p>Now, skipping over some details (Applicative) the other two
important interfaces are return and bind (also
called <code>and_then</code>).</p>

<pre>
class Monad container where
  return :: α → container α
  bind   :: container α → (α → container β) → container β
</pre>

<p>(<code>Bind</code> is usually spelled <code>>>=</code>.)</p>
<p><code>Return</code> just wraps the element in the container.</p>

<pre>
$ return x :: Maybe α
> Just x

$ return x :: [α]
> [x]
</pre>

<p><code>Bind</code> however is the more interesting part. In the case
of <code>Maybe</code> you might and an element and you have a function
that might give you a result.</p>

<pre>
$ bind (Just 2) (λx → Just (x + 1))
> Just 3
</pre>

<p><code>Bind</code> is essentially just a flattened <code>fmap</code>.</p>

<pre>
flatten :: Maybe (Maybe α) → Maybe α
flatten (Just (Just x) = Just x
flatten _              = Nothing

bind :: Maybe α → (α → Maybe β) → Maybe β
bind Nothing _  = Nothing
bind (Just x) f = f x

⇔

bind x f = flatten (fmap f x)
</pre>

For lists flatten is called <code>concat</code> and works like this:
<pre>
$ concat [[1, 2], [3], [4], [5, 6, 7]
> [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]
</pre>

<p>
You might've seen <code>flatMap</code>
or <code>concatMap</code>. They're <code>bind</code>!
</p>

<p>And that's all a monad is, a generic interface with these
operations.</p>

<h2>So, why?</h2>

Let's look at something else first.

<pre>
for n in [1, 2, 3] {
    f(n)
}
</pre>

<p>
This is a for loop. It's a standard construct in most languages
today. If we're in a statementless language (where everything is an
expression) a for-loop is basically just syntactic sugar for a map. If
the purpose of the loop is a sideeffect then you're collecting units
or IO actions, but you're still mapping.
</p>

<p> Let's rewrite this as a map. </p>
<pre>
fmap f [1, 2, 3]
</pre>

<p>
And to restrict us to the monadic interface let's switch to bind.
</p>
<pre>
fmap f xs
⇔
concat (map (return ∘ f) xs)
⇔
bind xs (return ∘ f)
</pre>

<p>
Now this seems kinda useless but we have syntactic sugar for this case
called do notation.
</p>

<pre>
do
  n ← [1, 2, 3]
  return (f x)
</pre>

<p>
Now that we're returning a list of a single element at the end of each
iteration we can also easily implement a filter function by returning
the empty list in cases we want to remove:
</p>

<pre>
filter :: (α → Bool) → [α] → [α]
filter cond xs = do
  n ← xs
  if (cond n)
    then [n]
    else []
</pre>

<p>
This might seem kinda useless as an extra language feature, why
don't we just have loops? Let's look at another example.
</p>

<p> This is C++. </p>
<pre>
// bar and bax may throw
int bar();
int baz();
int bax(int, int);

int foo() {
    int a = bar();
    int b = baz();

    return bax(a, b);
}
</pre>
<p>
We calculate two values and return a combined value. Some operations
may throw and can cancel our function. This is invisible and something
we can never rely on as all functions may always throw (ignoring C++11
noexcept). We can model this control flow explicitly with a more
classical C API (which is basically what Go still uses).
</p>
<pre>
error_t bar(int *out);
int baz();
error_t bax(int, int, int *out);

error_t foo(int *out) {
    int a, b, result;
    error_t failed;

    failed = bar(&a);
    if (failed) {
	return FAIL;
    }

    b = baz();

    failed = bax(a, b, &result);
    if (failed) {
	return FAIL;
    }

    *out = result;
    return OK;
}
</pre>

<p>
This works and is very clear what it's doing, but it's verbose and
error prone. What happens if we forget to check an error somewhere and
just start using the result? That's where Rust comes in with its enums
and Result type.
</p>

<pre>
fn bar()         → Result&lt;i32, E>;
fn baz()         → i32;
fn bax(i32, i32) → Result&lt;i32, E>;

fn foo() → Result&lt;i32, E> {
    let a;
    let b;

    match bar() {
	Ok(n) ⇒ a = n,
	Err(e) ⇒ return Err(e),
    }
    b = baz();

    bax(a, b)
}
</pre>

<p>
Now the types of the fallible functions force us to handle the errors
but it's still horribly verbose. Luckily Rust has
the <code>?</code>-operator to handle this common pattern.
</p>
<pre>
fn bar()         → Result&lt;i32, E>;
fn baz()         → i32;
fn bax(i32, i32) → Result&lt;i32, E>;

fn foo() → Result&lt;i32, E> {
    let a = bar()?;
    let b = baz();

    bax(a, b)
}
</pre>

<p>This version is finally explicit, safe and readable without any
major compromises. Here's the (super obvious) twist: Result is a
monad. We can compare this to the do-notiation version:</p>

<pre>
bar :: Maybe Int
baz :: Int
bax :: Maybe Int

foo = do
  a <- bar
  let b = baz
  bax a b
</pre>

<p>
The <code>?</code>-operator has become the <code><-</code> arrow and
the non-fallible operation has become a plain let. This then desugars to:
</p>

<pre>
bar :: Maybe Int
baz :: Int
bax :: Maybe Int

foo = bar >>= (λa → let b = baz in bax a b)
</pre>

<p>
If we had multiple fallible steps we could end up with (After fully
inlining the lambdas and the definition of bind above):
</p>

<pre>
foo = bar >>= (λa → baz >>= (λb → bax a b))
⇔
foo = case bar of
  Nothing → Nothing
  Just a  → case baz of
	      Nothing → Nothing
	      Just b  → bax a b
</pre>

<p>
Which shows that we're still just running each function, checking if
we need to short circuit evaluation and then going on to the next
step. <code>Maybe</code> and <code>Result ErrorType</code> are
essentially the same thing and close enough to exceptions. In other
words we have now modelled both for each loops and exceptions with the
same language feature and that's the point of monads. We have a single
language piece of syntax (do-notation) that can model a bunch of
language features provided by libraries rather than being language
builtins. Now, is this an actual good and practical thing or is it
just a cool idea? That's still up to debate. Monads are still
considered a very niche topic and even within the FP community where
people are aware of and use them tides seem to be turning against them
and towards algebraic effects.
</p>



<h2>Sidestory: Applicative</h2>

Next we have another interface that builds upon Functor called
Applicative. It's similar to (f)map but we also keep the function in
the container and has a way to wrap an element in a container.

<pre>
class Functor container ⇒ Applicative container where
  pure :: α → container α
  <*>  :: container (α → β) → container α → container β
</pre>

It using it looks like this:

<pre>
f = λx → x + 1

$ pure x
> Just x

$ pure f <*> pure 1 :: Maybe Int
> Just 2

$ Nothing <*> Just 1
> Nothing

$ Just f <*> Nothing
> Nothing

$ [f, g] <*> [x, y]
> [f x, f y, g x, g y]
</pre>
