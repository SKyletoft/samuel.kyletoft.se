			is a mess of mixed languages. A natural

			<ul>
				<li>
					<h3>Piste (noun) [Peest]<h3>
					<p>
						What beginners and Americans call a ski slope.
					</p>

					<h3>Piste (-bashing) (verb) [Peest]<h3>
					<p>
						
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<h3>Pomme [Pom]/[Pommeh]</h3>
					<p>
						An uncomfortable one-person lift dragging you up the
						hill. Apparently called buttons in America.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<h3>Anchor<h3>
					<p>
						A slightly more comfortable version of the pomme
