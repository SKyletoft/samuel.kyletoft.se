			Going skiing in the alps with English speakers
			is a mess of mixed languages. A natural
			consequence of <i>the alps not being in Britain.</i>

			Here's a list of words you should know.

			<ul>
				<li>
					<h4>Piste (noun) [Peest]<h4>
					<p>
						What beginners and Americans call a ski slope.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<h4>Piste (-bashing) (verb) [Peest]<h4>
					<p>
						
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<h4>Pomme [Pom]/[Pommeh]</h4>
					<p>
						An uncomfortable one-person lift dragging you up the
						hill. Apparently called buttons in America.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<h4>Anchor</h4>
					<p>
						A slightly more comfortable version of the pomme
						where the seat is replaced by an anchor so that two
						people can sit on it. Also known as T-bars.
					</p>
				</li>
			</ul>
